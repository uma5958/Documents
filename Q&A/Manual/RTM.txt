Q: What Is Requirement Traceability Matrix ?

Requirements tracing, a process of documenting the links between the requirements and the work products 
developed to implement and verify those requirements. 
Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) is a document which records the mapping between the high-level requirements and the test cases in the form of a table. 
The RTM captures all requirements and their traceability in a single document delivered at the conclusion of the life cycle.

Thatâ€™s how it ensures that the Test Plan covers all the requirements and links to their latest version.
